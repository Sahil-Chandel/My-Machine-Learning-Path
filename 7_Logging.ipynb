        "Logging is a crucial aspect of any application, providing a way to track events, errors and operational information. Python's built-in logging module offers a flexible framework for emitting log message from python program. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of logging, including how to configure logging, log levels and best practices for using logging in python application."
